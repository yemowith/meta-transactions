# Meta Transactions

This is a simple example of a meta transaction. It is a way to send a transaction to a contract that will then send a transaction to another contract.

# Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the contract.
3. Run `npm run relayer` to start the relayer.
4. Run `npm run sign` to sign the message.

# TODO

- [ ] Add a way to send a transaction to the contract from the relayer
- [ ] Add a way to send a transaction to the contract from the signer
